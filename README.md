Love to develop games, build helpful software, and solve problems using math!
I use Python, Java, Javascript, and C.
Currently learning Kotlin, C++, and Rust.

Studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

Working on a 2D-adventure game in my free time, and currently recreating an event from my Dnd Campaign as a board game.
