Hi, I’m @Travise42 (or Travise)!

I love to make video games and solve problems using math!
I’m currently learning Kotlin, Assembly and Rust.

As of August 2023, I finished an html/css/js recreation of Code Names (the board game).
I'm currently working on my game, Hoax - a 2D platformer involving magic.
